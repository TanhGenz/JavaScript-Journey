# Topic: JavaScript – cal the teams wins fundamental Part 2
# What i did:
to cal the average both teams dolphins and koalas => but only use 1 cal for both team => then i using function method
first i use function for calculate the average of both teams => then i pass 3 parameters (represent 3 rounds) into function to calc
i used arrow function because the topic make me do this (i still not distinguish between 2 function)
then i use another function for check who is the winner with 3 condition
if team A more than or equals team B plus 2 => Team A will wins; 
else if team B more than or euqals team A plus 2 => team B will wins
else both team not wins
the condition statement i make in 2 ways
first i use if else condition and then return the output i want
secondly i use a ternary operators for shorter 

# what i learned
i think i learn how the function flow runs
the return statement
=> the return is a statement that ends function execution and sends a value back to the caller.
# problem: 
first i still dont know what the main difference between default function and arrow function except the arrow function more shorter to read
secondly i still dont deep know the flow run of a ternary operators 
# how i solved:
i use again if else if statement and then i imagine the flow run of a ternary operators depends on if else
now i know when we use a a ternary operator => each ? : represents a conditional branch, similar to if / else if / else

the first i still in progress
# time spent: 
35 mins
# learn more: 
The main diference between arrrow function and default function => which case we should use arrow function
still deep research and hard know the flow run of a ternary operators









Coding Challenge #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time
