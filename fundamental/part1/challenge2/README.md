# Topic: JavaScript – BMI Challenge
# What i did: 
write a program to calculate the BMI between Mark and John, but in herre i use if/else conditions to compare and conssole.log with the string who is higher and log the BMI number\
i format the output console by template literal `${value} to interpolation`
 
# what i learned: 
i learn about the template literal => it make me more easier when i want to out the log with string and number

# problem:
 i dont have any err for now
# how i solved:
 
# time spent: 15 minute
# learn more: i need to update more the condition, the template literal


Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
# Hint: Use an if/else statement
