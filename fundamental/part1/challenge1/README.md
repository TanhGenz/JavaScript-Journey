# Dev Log – 03/01/2026
# Topic: JavaScript – BMI Challenge
# What i did: 
 write a programn to calculate for Mark and John by the formula BMI = mass / height * height 
 Compare BMI between Mark and John to check who have the higher BMI than the other one
 Log to console
# what i learned:
 i know how to the booleans not have to declare true or false => its just declare any thing 
# problem:
 wrong input the height, its call the meters (float number) => but i input centimeters (int number)
 initial i declare a variable with true false value, and use if else condition (the task not recommend use condition for now)
# how i solved:
 i change the declare a variable by `const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI` => the variables will true or false
# time spent: 45 minute
# learn more booleans
 

Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
# Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
# Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall.
