# What i did: 
declare 3 variable for 3 rounds both dolphins and koalas
calculate the average after 3 rounds by the logics `( round1 + round2 + round 3) / 3`
use if - else condition to compare Koalas and Dolphins team after 3 rounds

using comparison operator to compare which team has a higher score or equals the scores
`>`: greater
`<`: less
`>=`: Greater than or equal 
`<=`: less than or equal
`==`: Equality
`===`: Strict equality
`!=` Inequality
`!==`: Strict Inequality

then using logical operator  for the second condition is each team have more than 100 points to wins
`&&`: logical AND 
`||`: logical OR 
`!`:  logical NOT

Then comparison and output the team has higher score than other teams and the conditions to wins must have at least 100 points or not team winds to day
# what i learned: 
i learns about if-else condition, the logical and the comparision operators
# problem:
# how i solved:

# time spent: 30 minute
# learn more: i need to practice more about the logical conditions, the ways i split detail conditions








Coding Challenge #3
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
score of at least 100 points. 
# Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
Test data:
§ Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
§ Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
§ Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
