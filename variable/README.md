# Name: JS – variable
Date: 31/12
Topic: variables
What I did: watch the videos about let, const var, and do 1 exercise
What I learned: knowing TDZ, runtime behavior, the phase JS run (first i think JS run top to bottom) 
Problem: dont know runtimee behavior and TDZ so deep, 
How I solved: take note the TDZ, runtime behavior, try to think the way JS run
Time spent (h): 3h30
Result: On-going
Next plan: do 5 ex about run time bahavior, TDZ
